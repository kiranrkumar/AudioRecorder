         DemoRecorder[5930:2262392] [avas] AVAudioSessionPortImpl.mm:56:ValidateRequiredFields: Unknown selected data source for Port Speaker (type: Speaker)
         DemoRecorder[5930:2262392] [avas] AVAudioSessionPortImpl.mm:56:ValidateRequiredFields: Unknown selected data source for Port Receiver (type: Receiver)
         
         These errors would show up, and my first segment of recorded audio would not play back. Subsequent segments would work just fine
         
         The fix below (from https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/108785) does not get rid of the errors, but it DOES fix the issues that initially prevented me from playing back my first recording. Additionally, it significantly raises the playback volume.
         
         I don't know what these two lines really do. I'll have to investigate
